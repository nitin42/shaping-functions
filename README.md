> Visualisation of shaping functions

## Introduction

This is visualisation of shaping functions used in algorithmic drawing. I am learning shaders and mathematics required for computer graphics. As a part of my learning process, I decided to port [these](http://www.iquilezles.org/www/articles/functions/functions.html) shaping functions written by [Inigo Quilez](http://www.iquilezles.org/index.html). On his [blog](http://www.iquilezles.org/www/index.htm), he explains the use cases for shaping functions such as - animations, or making envelopes for music.

## Future

I'll keep updating the collection (of shaping functions) as I write my own functions for algorithmic drawing.

## Resources

I am learning about shaders and glsl from [thebookofshaders](https://thebookofshaders.com/).
